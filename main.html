Tony was sure he would have gone mad, or drunk himself into a stupor without Loki to keep him together.

And the thing was, Tony didn’t know why Loki did it. He was going far beyond the bounds of friendship. Tony had worried, at first, that it was residual guilt for not being able to heal Tony. When he’d asked, Loki had shaken his head.

I wish I could have done more, and I’m angry that I couldn’t, Loki signed, but I know you do not blame me. I know there was nothing I could have done.

Good, Tony had insisted, because I don’t blame you. This isn't your fault.

Loki had smiled at him, and after that, the conversation had been dropped.

But, it had been months, and Loki was still hovering at his side, still dropping everything to help him or keep Tony from getting lost in his own head.

Tony appreciated it, God, he truly, absolutely did. He felt like they’d grown closer as well, like a new intimacy had been forged between them. Tony just didn’t understand it.

It was as they were sitting in the penthouse and Loki was telling him a story about his childhood on Asgard that things clicked. Tony was laughing and his eyes were pinched with amusement even as he was signing back - when a hand caught his. Tony stilled and opened his eyes. Loki was watching him with aching affection.

Oh, he thought, the realisastion sudden yet so simple, that’s why.

And, instead of it being a panicked understanding or a daunting implication, Tony just let his smile turn tender as he curled his fingers around Loki’s.

Because, even though he’d always considered Loki a friend, it didn’t mean that Tony hadn’t been aware of the potential for a long time. He’d always ignored it, always assumed that Loki wouldn’t want to be with a middle-aged mortal.

When he became a middle-aged, deaf mortal, he’d thought his chances had plummeted even further into obscurity – but, here Loki was, looking at him as if he was the mage’s entire world.

It was why he tugged on Loki’s hand, encouraging him closer. Loki’s joy shone from his eyes, and Tony watched him for as long as he could before shutting his eyes. When Loki’s lips caught his a second later, Tony sighed into the touch.

He brought his free hand to Loki’s hair, curling in the strands, while Loki’s hand came to his neck. Their fingers remained linked, and Tony’s whole world was narrowed down to the feel and scent of Loki.

Tony could have kissed him forever, but just because he was melting into the kiss and enjoying the feel of Loki’s lips, it didn’t mean he missed a single, reverent word: Anthony.

It was wistful and delighted and it was Loki’s voice inside his head.

Tony jerked back from the kiss. His eyes were wide and he let Loki’s hair go and signed rapidly in front of the other man’s startled face.

I heard you speaking in my head!!

Unlikely the happiness or delight he expected, Loki went pale and horror flashed across his face. He hurriedly signed: I’m so sorry, Anthony!

Tony frowned, completely confused, but Loki was continuing, his hand moving rapidly.

I never meant to invade your privacy or break your trust. I didn’t mean to mind speak with you. It won’t happen again. I won’t-

Tony grabbed Loki’s hand, stopping his panicked explanations. He shook his head rapidly. He let Loki’s hand go and explained: Loki, don’t apologise. This is amazing! I’ve missed hearing your voice! I want to hear you! Do it again?

Loki looked hesitant, but he reached out one hand and brushed his fingers to Tony’s temple. There was a moment where nothing happened before, “Anthony? Is this alright?”

“Loki,” Tony thought back, his delight unable to be contained. “It is more than alright.”

Loki smiled and his fingers trailed down, brushing over Tony’s cheek. “I was afraid you would not trust me enough for this.”

“Why?”

“It’s intimate. Few people like a mage in their head, especially not me.”

“I’m not like other people,” Tony said, leaning into the hand now cupping his cheek. “And I want you here.”

Loki’s smile spread wider. “Then I’ll stay.”

Tony blinked, looking at Loki and realising he was speaking about more than just the mental connection, he was speaking about something far deeper.

But, just like everything else that involved Loki, the thought wasn’t daunting or nerve-wracking, it only made Tony feel happy and content; because if Loki was with him, Tony knew everything would be okay.

And, to further prove those words and his own commitment, Tony leant in and pressed his lips to Loki’s.

He also whispered his happiness and gratitude into Loki’s mind with a single, honest statement: “Thank you, for making everything better, Loki.”

Notes:
Okay so, yes, I know that in the comics Clint is deaf, but it didn't fit with my plot/feels to make him deaf. So his brother is deaf. Shhh.

Anyway, I hope you liked! :)
