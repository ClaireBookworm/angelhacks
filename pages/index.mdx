## FAQ

<Callout sx={{ mx: [null, null, -3, -4] }}>
<FAQ>

- **How much does it cost?**
  Nothing! Registration and attendance are 100% free, with meals, drinks, swag, & workshops included.

- **Who can participate?**
  Any current student grades 8‚Äì12. If you‚Äôre under/over that age, send us a chat message (in the bottom right corner) & we‚Äôll see what we can do.

- **Hacking‚ÄΩ Is that safe?**
  No, we‚Äôre not ‚Äúhacking‚Äù servers. The word is being constructively redefined for coding‚Äîapps, games, websites. It‚Äôs safe, supervised, & entirely educational.

- **What can I make?**
  Anything! A website, app, game, hardware hack, you name it. Judges will rate projects on creativity, technical skill demonstrated, polish, and utility.

- **What if I‚Äôm new to coding?**
  At AngelHacks, complete beginners are not only welcome, but expected! Learn as you go with our intro workshops & mentors.

- **Do I need a team?**
  Nope! You‚Äôll have an opportunity to meet fellow hackers and make teams of up to 4‚Äîfind some new friends, bring yours, or work alone.

- **What should I bring?**
  Plan to bring a student ID, computer (any kind), chargers, anything for your hack (e.g. hardware), toiletries, & a sleeping bag (if you plan on sleeping).

- **Who runs this? Is it supervised?**
  We‚Äôre independently-organized by high schoolers, sponsored via a nonprofit called [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/). It‚Äôs fully supervised by 20+ adult mentors & chaperones.
