# We’re driven by a mission.

Technology is by far the fastest growing industry in the U.S. with hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs and employers desperate for talent—but nearly all of the opportunities are on the coasts. In 2017 alone, there were 30 hackathons for high schoolers in California with thousands of students in attendance. Pennsylvania had none.

Hack Happy Valley will be the first high school hackathon in Central Pennsylvania, bringing technology to the forefront of our community. 50 students of all skill levels will assemble for a weekend of collaboration and innovation, each building apps/websites/games in 24 hours. Then participants and judges will select the winning projects and teams.

# Coding is a superpower.
Starting to code has a lasting impact. Once you begin coding, you switch from being a consumer to being a creator. We want to make everyone a creator—it’s a magical transformation. You can solve problems your way, bounded only by your imagination.

We know this because we’re the leaders of the [Hack Club](https://hackclub/) at State College Area High School, where hundreds of students have come to write their first code. Now, we want to bring that experience to everyone. This is a hackathon by the students, for the students, and for the future of Pennsylvania.
